  	<h1 class="display-5 text-center text-md-left">FAQ</h1>
	  <p>How much does it cost?</p>
	  <p class="text-muted">
	  	It's totally free.
	  	If you'd like to help support this app and other ChiPy offerings, please consider
	  	<a href="https://www.chipy.org/pages/donate/">donating</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>Who can participate?</p>
	  <p class="text-muted">
	  	Anyone who lives in the Chicago-land area
	  	or who can physically be in the Chicago-land area to meet with their Buddy.
	  	While buddies can meet remotely,
	  	the ability to meet in-person is of huge benefit.
	  	Also, ChiPy is a Chicago-local organization :).
	  </p>

	  <p>Do I need to know X?</p>
	  <p class="text-muted">
		  Nope. We welcome folks of any level of prior knowledge.
		  Totally new to Python or programming? No problem.
		  Experienced Webdev who wants to learn some data science? Awesome!
		</p>

	  <p>How long should a buddy relationship last?</p>
	  <p class="text-muted">
	  	You can meet with your buddy as many or few times as you want,
	  	over as long or short of a period as you want.
	  	Generally we suggest targeting longer-term relationships, with multiple meetings over a period of months or longer.
	  </p>

	  <p>Where should we meet?</p>
	  <p class="text-muted">
	  	Given the current Covid-19 pandemic, all meetings should be held remotely.
	  	Once it is safe to meet in person, we suggest public spaces to promote safety.
	  </p>

	  <p>What's an appropriate relationship between a mentee/mentor?</p>
	  <p class="text-muted">
	  	We want our ChiPyBuddies to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
	  	Accordingly, every participant is expected to show respect and courtesy to each other.
	  	To make clear what is expected,
	  	all participants are required to conform to ChiPy's Code of Conduct at all times.
	  	Read our full Code of Conduct <a href="https://www.chipy.org/pages/conduct/">here</a>.
	  	If you have any concerns you should immediately contact ChiPy organizers
	  	in-person, on Slack, or text/call the On-Call responder at 1+201-778-4075. 
	  </p>

	  <p>Is this the same thing as ChiPy's mentorship program?</p>
	  <p class="text-muted">
	  	No. ChiPy's Mentorship Program was a twice-annual, 13-week structured program where participating mentees worked with their mentor to complete a selected project, while blogging about/presenting the process/results and participating in Project Nights. The program ran from Fall 2014 through Fall 2019. It was discontinued in favor of opening up access to mentorship experiences via this app as well as several other programs.
